#Reel Seek: A movie searching app

This app utilizes AngularJS to access [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and to display results.

The front page features a list of movies that are searched by their IMDb ID. The poster, plot, date, rating, and small details are listed on the front page with links to a full page listing.

The search page allows users to search for films by title (to return multiple results), or by title and year (for one result). Each result links to a full Movie page.

The movie page pulls up extended plot, rotten tomatoes ratings and more to display more information about the film. In addition to director, actor, writer credits, there is also information about awards, ratings, and a link to the film's IMDb page.

##Notes
In the future, I'd like to add:
 * a top ten list for current movies to the front page, utilizing Metacritic's RSS feed.
 * display the front page films in a carousel for a better landing page.
